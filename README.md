In this implementation we test [Digikala website](https://www.digikala.com/) search box using Selenium IDE by doing:

1. Search for an item using the search box
2. Check if all the title of the results contains the searched item (first five pages of the results)
3. Sort products by price high to low
4. Check if the result is actually sorted by highest price (first five pages of the results)
